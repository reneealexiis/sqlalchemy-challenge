# sqlalchemy-challenge

Hello! 

I did not work with anyone on this assignment. 
I used the XPert Learning Assistant to help write the code and did consult with the BCS Learning Assistant on a few items. 

You may find my final script for the Climate Analysis in the "RP.climate.ipynb" document. 
You may find my Climate App API in the "app.py" document. 
Both of these documents are located in the "SurfsUp" directory located in the sqlalchemy-challenge folder. 

Thank you!
