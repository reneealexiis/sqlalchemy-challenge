# sqlalchemy-challenge

# Project Overview 
In this project I was tasked with doing a climate analysis on Honolulu, Hawaii, to assist in trip planning. 
I used SQLAlchemy ORM, Pandas and Matplotlib to create a basic climate analysis, including a precipitation and station analysis on the area. 

## Analysis of Findings 
You may find my final script for the Climate Analysis in the "RP.climate.ipynb" document. 
You may find my Climate App API in the "app.py" document. 
Both of these documents are located in the "SurfsUp" directory located in the sqlalchemy-challenge folder. 

### Instructions to Final Work 
I did not work with anyone on this assignment. 
I used the XPert Learning Assistant to help write the code and did consult with the BCS Learning Assistant on a few items. 

You may find my final script for the Climate Analysis in the "RP.climate.ipynb" document. 
You may find my Climate App API in the "app.py" document. 
Both of these documents are located in the "SurfsUp" directory located in the sqlalchemy-challenge folder. 

Thank you!
